#### Identification 
DP Question usually asks 1. choice 2. optimal (min value or max value)
DP is used to solve problem with overlapping recursion
First try to write the recursive solution then memoize it then if you want to tabulation
The base case of recursion is usually the smallest valid input

#### Tabulation 
Convert the base cases into initialization of the matrix
Convert the recursive calls into the iterative calls to solve the problem

#### Problems
Based on knapsack
1.knapsack
2. subset sum
3. equal sum partition
4. Count of subset with given sum
5. Minimum subset sum difference
6. Target sum
7. Number of subsets with given difference
